# RealWaste-image-classification
a deep learning model for image classification

# Waste Classifier Project

This is a machine learning model that can classify items by images into predefined categories using algorithms taught in class(McMaster) and their extensions.

This project uses the **RealWaste dataset**, a collection of authentic, labeled images of waste items provided by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/908/realwaste). The model is designed to support the field of waste management, where accurate sorting can improve the efficiency of recycling and disposal processes, contributing to environmental sustainability.

## Project Structure

The notebook (`wasteclassifier514.ipynb`) is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis**  
2. **Training Preparation**  
3. **Model Building**  
4. **Model Training**  
5. **Evaluation**
6. **robustness testing**

## Note on Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository due to size, but it can be downloaded directly from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/908/realwaste).
