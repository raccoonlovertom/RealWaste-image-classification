# RealWaste Image Classifier

This project develops a machine learning model that classifies waste images into **nine predefined categories**:

- Cardboard  
- Food Organics  
- Glass  
- Metal  
- Miscellaneous Trash  
- Paper  
- Plastic  
- Textile Trash  
- Vegetation  

The model is trained on the **RealWaste dataset**, a collection of authentic, labeled images of waste items provided by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/908/realwaste).  
Accurate waste classification can improve recycling and disposal efficiency, contributing to more sustainable waste management practices.

The notebook includes **step-by-step code with comments and visualizations** to make the workflow easy to follow.

1. **Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis**  
2. **Training Preparation**  
3. **Model Building**  
4. **Model Training**  
5. **Evaluation**  
6. **Robustness Testing**

## Dataset

The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints, but it can be downloaded directly from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/908/realwaste).
